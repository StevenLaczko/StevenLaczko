- Hi, Iâ€™m @StevenLaczko. I'm a software developer currently studying at UMBC. I get passionate when making an idea a reality. 
- I enjoy making practical apps that get used frequently. My in-progress Discord bot, Boris, is primarily a vehicle for useful functions like reminders and letting people play a game of Mafia.
- You can always reach my at my email, StevenDLaczko@gmail.com
