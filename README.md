- Hi, Iâ€™m @StevenLaczko. I recently graduated from UMBC with a BS in somputer science with a minor in math.
- I think it would be cool if we all went back to saying *programming* instead of *developing apps*.
- I run base Debian with AwesomeWM.
- I am a Vim lover. Well, NeoVim, now.
- You can always reach my at my email, StevenDLaczko@gmail.com
